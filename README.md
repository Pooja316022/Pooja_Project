# Prediction of Crop Yields Using India Agriculture Crop Production Dataset

Overview of project:
The project "Crop Yield Prediction in Agriculture Using Machine Learning" is a comprehensive exploration of data science techniques applied to the agricultural domain. Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, and accurate predictions of crop yields are crucial for effective resource allocation, planning, and ensuring food security. This project aims to address these challenges by harnessing the power of machine learning to predict crop yields in India.
The project begins with data preprocessing, focusing on cleaning and preparing a dataset sourced from Kaggle. Key steps include handling missing values, outlier detection, and data encoding. The dataset consists of attributes such as state, district, crop type, year, season, area under cultivation, production, and crop yield.
Various machine learning regression algorithms are then applied, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression. These algorithms are rigorously evaluated and compared based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) to identify the most effective model for crop yield prediction.
A user-friendly and interactive interface is developed to enable stakeholders, including farmers and government authorities, to make data-driven decisions. This interface allows users to customize predictions by selecting specific states, districts, crops, years, and seasons.
